# Hello there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width=30>

My name is ***Prémices Kamasuwa***. <br>

I'm a highly experienced Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience working remotely in distributed teams.<br>
I'm passionate about building large distributed systems and I've been lucky to work on quite a number of them.<br>
I'm versatile and comfortable to work on a variable set of stacks and technologies. <br>

You can find me on [![Twitter][1.2]][1],  or on [![LinkedIn][3.2]][3].
